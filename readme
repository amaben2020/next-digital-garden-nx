Creating a project : npx create-nx-workspace domsmith --packageManager=yarn

Running the server: yarn nx serve or yarn nx run site:serve

creating a folder with file: yarn nx g @nrwl/next:page --name"[slug]" --style=none --directory=articles --dry-run

Setting up tailwind: Note, you have to install in the base i.e domsmith but configure in the required monorepo i.e site

Build: yarn nx build site

Optimizing build for tailwind: i.e purging for unused tailwind files
Go to tailwind.config
